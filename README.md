#### CompareCSV

This is a simple program that produces a csv. The ruby version of the program produces a csv with first name, last name and email. The C++ version of the program produces a csv with email.

##### The Use Case

This program is useful to run when building email lists for marketing campaigns. You might have many different forms for email submission - newsletter forms, generic contact forms, giveaway forms, etc. These forms may feed into many different lists. By the time you are ready to send out mass marketing emails, some people in these lists may have already signed up for your services and should not receive your marketing emails.
